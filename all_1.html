<p>As the name implies, the analysis or the classification of P2P traffic is a flow-based, focusing on the connection level patterns of P2P applications. Thus, it does not require any payload analysis, unlike DPI. Because it doesn’t require payload analysis, encrypted data packets can be easily supported. The down side of this approach is that there is an additional step of extracting the connection level pattern for the P2P traffics. And yet, there is no rule of thumb for which network feature should be used in this method. </p>

<h3 id="toc_3">2.2</h3>

<h4 id="toc_4">2.2.1 Ground truth generation</h4>

<p>The ground truth is the packet flows with known classes. In order to train a classifier, there are two types of packet flows needed to capture, namely the BT and non-BT packet flows. To capture the BT packets, I manually force the BT client to use a single TCP port (i.e. 1200) for data transfer. Thus, all the BT traffic must go through thisTCP port. Then, I start a sample torrent file and the BT client will automatically start downloading/uploading the contents. At the same time, I start my packet capturing program to obtain the packets.Similarly, to capture non-BT packets, I start my packet capturing program while we were creating non-BT network activities including HTTP,FTP and SSH. With the known class of the packets in the PCAP files, I could start training the classifier.    </p>

<h4 id="toc_5">2.2.2  Study of DFI classifier accuracy</h4>

<p><img src="media/15139994534279/%E3%82%B9%E3%82%AF%E3%83%AA%E3%83%BC%E3%83%B3%E3%82%B7%E3%83%A7%E3%83%83%E3%83%88%202017-12-23%2012.38.56.png" alt="スクリーンショット 2017-12-23 12.38.56"/><br/>
** Figure 2: Classifier accuracy with different training samples **<br/>
Figure 2 shows the classifier accuracy with increasing number of BT packet flows used to train the classifier. The classifier was first trained with a set of BT samples, and then it was tested against with some otherBT packet flows to observe the accuracy. This experiment gives us some clues about the number of packet flows should be used in order train a reliable classifier for the DFI module.As expected, the moreBT packets are used to train the classifier, the better the accuracy is. However, as the number of the BT packets increase, the classifier will be saturated at some point.  After that, even more packets is provided, the accuracy does not increase significantly.   </p>

                  <h1>Thoughts on the Nintendo Switch</h1>
                  <div class="a-content">
                      
                      <div class="a-content-text">
                        
                        	<p>This past weekend marked the first time the public got their hands on the newest console coming from Nintendo, the Nintendo Switch. The Switch’s first look and other imagery has shown what looks like an older target audience than kids and families, a switch (no pun intended) from Nintendo’s other consoles. So will it make a good family console, like the Wii U?  </p>

<p>I had a chance to get my hands on it and I’m convinced the Switch will be our next must-have console for the entire family. “Nintendo Switch is for everyone,” Cindy Gordon, Nintendo’s VP of Corporate Affairs told me. Here are a few reasons why you should consider picking it up for family.  </p>

<h1 id="toc_0">The game line-up is as great as you’d expect — and more.</h1>

<p>There are some things you can anticipate when a new Nintendo console is announced — a new Legend of Zelda, a new Mario adventure, and memorable party games are just a few of Nintendo’s area of expertise that gamers have come to expect, and the Switch will deliver on all of those. (Super Mario Odyssey is such a big adventure, however, that it won’t be available until later in the year.)  </p>

<p>But the Nintendo Switch is also branching out into new games and franchises that have never been on a Nintendo system before. The Elder Scrolls: Skyrim, FIFA, and NBA 2K are also headed to the Switch, and Nintendo is committed to working with third-party developers for an even more diverse offering of games.  </p>

<h1 id="toc_1">The Switch is incredibly portable.</h1>

<p>Easily the most appealing part of the Nintendo Switch is the hassle-free portability. The screen quickly and simply undocks from the console, the Joy-Con controllers attach to the side, and you instantly have a portable game with high-quality graphics that look just as good as they do on the TV.  </p>

<p>If you’ve ever dreamed about playing Skyrim during a long flight or the kids having Splatoon battles in the backseat on the way to Grandma’s, the Switch is about to make that a reality–without any cords or mess, said Gordon. Battery life ranges from two-and-a-half to six-and-a-half hours, depending on the game. The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild will last about three hours before needing to recharge, estimated Gordon.   </p>

<h1 id="toc_2">The controllers are made for hands of all sizes.</h1>

<p>The Switch’s controllers, known as Joy-Con, are surprisingly small and can fit hands of all sizes and ages. “Joy-Con are little technological feats of innovation that pack a powerful punch,” Gordon said.  </p>

<p>The innovative design allows different ways to play depending on the game you’re playing. Attach it to the sides of the screen for gaming on the go, use it as a traditional controller, or pull the two pieces apart and use them similar to Wiimotes. Kids and adults alike will appreciate the flexibility.  </p>

<p>When separated, you can also turn the Joy-Con horizontally and use it in a style similar to the original NES controller. I had the chance to play Mario Kart 8 Deluxe with it in that manner, however, and even my small hands started to cramp a little due to the tiny controller. Parents may want to pick up the Pro Controller if they’ll be doing just as much gaming as the kids.  </p>

<h1 id="toc_3">Parental controls are built in.</h1>

<p>You know.  </p>

                        	<p>A recent <a href="https://www.nature.com/news/can-artificial-intelligence-create-the-next-wonder-material-1.19850">Nature article</a> examines how materials researchers are using artificial intelligence to make quantum-mechanical calculations in only a few seconds that once took supercomputers hours to complete.  </p>

<p>These computer modeling and machine-learning techniques are generating enormous libraries of materials candidates. Researchers hope that this approach will produce a giant leap in the speed and usefulness of materials discovery. British materials scientist Neil Alford observes, “We are now seeing a real convergence of what experimentalists want and what theorists can deliver.”  </p>

<p>The most promising results so far have been achieved with lithium compounds, used in batteries and other applications..  </p>

<p>The Nature article also argues that “artificial intelligence will help researchers comb through vast numbers of materials to find just the one they need for the application at hand.” The standard process starts with researchers applying machine learning to lab data and computer modeling in order to extract common patterns and predict new materials. Researchers then look for a material with specific properties and pass along their findings to chemists, who try to produce the theoretical material for testing.  </p>

<p>Personally, I think huge opportunities are available from these types of materials databases — the potential is almost limitless. The advances made so far remind me of the robotic discovery efforts at Dow, the advances made by Bristol-Myers Squibb and other pharmaceutical companies, and recent virus discoveries, such as the ones made by Angie Belcher’s group. These discoveries have resulted in everything from catalysts for oxidative coupling of methane to battery electrode materials. These types of efforts are the physical analog to the computational approaches described in these material databases.  </p>

<p>Transforming computer predictions to real-world technologies, however, is difficult. Existing databases include a small fraction of all the known materials and only a few possible ones. Researchers have also learned that data-driven discovery works well for some materials, but not for others. And even when researchers successfully isolate a material with potential, it can take years for chemists to synthesize it in a lab.  </p>

<p>Despite these challenges, researchers remain confident that they will discover many useful materials that could lead to innovations in electronics, robotics, healthcare, and other fields. In my opinion, the key for researchers is to avoid the scattershot approach. If scientists can try everything, how do we decide where to focus our efforts? To focus the research there must still be brains behind the computational or robotic synthesis efforts. We need to ensure that we aren’t trying to boil the ocean.  </p>

<p>I believe that success will require collaboration between different disciplines and groups. For example, people who understand the computational work may not completely understand the physical impact on materials. We must combine those two areas to provide meaningful information that can be used to impact physical materials. Information inside a computer is only useful if we can translate it to the physical world.  </p>
